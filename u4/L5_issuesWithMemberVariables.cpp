    // (so that objects with different parameters that are essentially the same are represented the same way)

    // ------------------------------------------

    // To avoid problems (eg. wild pointers, null pointers, memory leaks),
    // deal with the creation of the object from CREATION, EXISTENCE, to DESTRUCTION

    // Terminology:
    // 1. Constructors... deal with initialization
    // 2. Member Functions... deal with accessing and manipulating
    // 3. Destructors... deal with clean-up (ie. deallocation)

    // ------------------------------------------

    // Encapsulation: protection of data (!= security)
